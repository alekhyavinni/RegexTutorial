# Regular Expression - Matching an Email

Regular expressions, often referred to as regex, refers to a distinct string usually made up of various sets of characters that can be used as both a query tool and a validator in code bases, as well as traditional documents. They were dervied in the early 1950s out of the concept of regular language coined by the mathemitician Stephen Cole Kleene. They became widely used in 1968 within the theoretical computer science field as a way to match patterns within text files and support lexical analysis. Although regular expressions are known for being extremely cryptic looking, when broken down piece by piece, one can see they are not quite as complex as they look to the untrained eye, and one could start writing their own regex expressions fairly easily.
